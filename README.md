# Structure Factor for 2D particles 

Compute the structure factor of a 2D system of particles. 
The program accept as input a file with two columns with the x and y positions and return the contour plot of the structure factor.
Moreover, if the system is a square box, compute the spherical average of the structure factor

## Installation and usage

To install the program, you just need to clone the repository on your local PC. You need to have python3 installed in the system.
You can run the program then as
